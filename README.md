# Broadband optical spectroscopy and machine learning for tissue classification
// TODO // 
Create a much more informative read me.
Split my code into the various processing steps rather than having everything in one document

// Summary //
This repo is where all of the code is stored for the Broadband Optical Spectroscopy will be stored including preprocessing, algorithms, and slicer modules.
